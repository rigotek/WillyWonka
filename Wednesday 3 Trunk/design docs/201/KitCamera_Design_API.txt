---------------------------------API--------------------------------------------------
Kit Camera API

The following method, DoXXX() will tell the GUI to perform  an action. In this context, the GUI refers to the Kit Camera 
on the animation part. Since the 200 student are assigned different parts for the GUI/animation, then these methods are 
meant for the Kit Camera GUI. The other methods, msgXXX(), will be a mechanism that handles how the agents are notified 
about certain animation being done. When the animation is done, the Kit Camera GUI will send a message to the agent about 
its finished work.

•DoTakePicture(Kit)
This method tells the GUI to take a picture of the Kit being inspected. The Kit must exist on the furthest-left position 
of the Kit Stand, in order, to take a valid picture.

•msgDoneTakingPicture(Kit)
The GUI notifies the Kit Robot that a picture has been taken of the Kit being inspected. The kit robot will then proceed 
as necessary. 

-----------------------------Non-normative: Kit Missing parts-------------------------------------------------------

The inspection camera will detect a missing part and tell the kit robot about the bad kit. The Kit Robot will then take 
the bad kit back into an available slot. In order to guaranteed an available slot, the Kit Robot will not create any 
new kit until the report comes back from the Kit camera. It will stop creating kits when a kit is being inspected. 
Let say, a kit is being inspected, and the user wants a new kit. the Kit Robot will take in the new kit configuration. 
However, It will not create the kit if only one slot is available. When the report comes back saying the kit is bad, the 
kit robot will have a slot available since that same slot was used by the kit being inspected. The Gui Robot just needs 
to place the bad kit on the available slot. If the report comes back saying kit is good, proceed as normal(place kit on 
boat and create a new kit).So,gui kit robot will only carry one kit in all cases while Kit camera will detect bad kits.  

Method Used in this scenario are the following:
•checkIfkitIsGood(Mykit)
•inspection(Mykit)
•msgKitIsbad(Kit);


All these methods are designed above.
