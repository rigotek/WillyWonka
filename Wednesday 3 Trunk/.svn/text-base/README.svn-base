Kitting Cell - V2

**WE MADE A SMALL REVISION, ONE COMMENTED OUT LINE MAKES OUR ENTIRE FACTORY WORK PERFECT**

This is the complete V2 Kitting Cell Factory for CS200/201 team WEDNESDAY 3.

Our factory is a Willy Wonka candy-themed factory that creates kits of candy.
We have made several design choices for our factory which is detailed here

RUN
	In order to run the factory, please go to gui/ux/MainInterface.java and build and run that file.
	Be sure to click the start button and that will open the gates to the factory. Also, you cannot 
	create a kit until the factory is running completely so make sure to click start before anything.
	
INTERFACE
	All kits consist of anywhere from 4-8 parts. The default is that all of the parts in the kit are of type1 (Wonka Bars)
	and the entire factory will work to fill that kit with 8 wonka bars. To change the configuration of
	the kit, go to the combo box and click the part type you want to add to the current configuration and 
	then click on one of the 8 buttons with pictures of the current candy in the kit to switch that new candy
	into the kit. So, if I wanted to make 7 part1, and 1 part2 I would go to the combo box and select part2.
	Then I would click on any one of the images of part1. Then I would type 1 in the text box and click create
	to make one kit of that configuration. If you want less than 8 parts in a kit, scroll up to the top of the
	combo box, and click the remove option. Then, click on the number of kits you would like to remove. Then hit start.
	
AGENT INTERACTION
	We tried to mimic real life with the way our factory works so the flow is as follows. First a kit is created
	and that is sent on to the kit stand and then the kit stand tells the parts robot of that change. The parts
	robot who is told by the lane cameras which part types are in which nests will allocate the nests to switch
	their part type in order to correctly distribute the needed part types across the factory. This ensures that
	the gantry is always brining in the correct part type without wasting resources too much. Furthermore, the 
	gantry is a state machine so it won't start loading the second lane with a new type until the current bin has 
	finished dumping its parts into the feeder.
	
Basic Tests we have run that work:
All of 1 part type...............................................WORKS
7 of 1 part type, 1 of another part type.........................WORKS
6 of 1 part type, 2 of another part type.........................WORKS
5 of 1 part type, 3 of another part type.........................WORKS
4 of 1 part type, 4 of another part type.........................WORKS
...so on and so forth

Making multiple of the same configuration by entering 2 or more in the text box.

Please note that the kit camera is just a flash and it goes off quickly so it is easy to miss. Also, both of the 
cameras are on timers so even though it may look like its not doing anything, it really is just waiting for the 
timer to go off. 

**Please note that it takes a while to get all of the part types on the factory. I mean A REALLY LONG TIME. BE PATIENT**

NON NORMATIVES
	To activate the non-normatives, click on the non-normatives tab of the control panel. 
	
	nom nom chocolate
		Draining the ocean has the effect of stopping the factory since all of the robots operated on chocolate.
		Clicking the button again will get Charlie to refill the factory with chocolate and everything will
		go back to working fine.
		
	choco nami
		The large wave of chocolate comes on the screen and resets everything. All of the candy, etc. comes off 
		and the whole factory starts afresh. Clicking the fix, resets the entire factory.
		
	bubble
		All of the candies currently on a lane will get caught in a bubble from the fizzy drink. The candy will then
		float around on screen until it eventually gets up so high that is off the screen completely and gone forever.
		
	utlimate rebellion
		The oompa loompahs are going on strike and they have their own song that they revolt too. The oompa loompahs
		will dance around on screen randomly until you click the button again and charlie settles them down again.

Thank You.
